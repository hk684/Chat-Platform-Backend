Chosen bonus feature(s): Dark mode & hangman
Explanation (~100 words):
Dark mode:
Toggle between dark and light mode. A switched is implemented and placed at the bottom
of the webpage so once it's being clicked on the background colour will switch froom white
to purple.
Hangman:
Takes in user inputs of letters, if letter is correct, then it'll show up above the "blue lines"
if it's wrong then it'll be placed inside the "wrong container". The user only has 6 chances to make
mistakes before they lose the game. Also repeated letters entered will be ignored
